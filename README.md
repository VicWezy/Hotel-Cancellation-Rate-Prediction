# Hotel-Cancellation-Rate-Prediction

This project aims to predict the hotel cancellation rate for Marriott Hotels. By understanding the factors influencing cancellations and developing an accurate predictive model, Marriott Hotels can optimize revenue and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The hotel industry faces challenges due to booking cancellations, which can lead to revenue loss and operational inefficiencies. By accurately predicting hotel cancellation rates, Marriott Hotels can proactively address these challenges.

The analysis and prediction are based on the "hotel_bookings.csv" dataset. This dataset serves as the foundation for the analysis and predictive modeling. By exploring this dataset, we aim to identify relationships between variables and cancellations, uncover patterns, and derive insights to develop an accurate cancellation rate prediction model.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following phases:

1. **Read in Data**: Loading and importing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and unreasonable data.
3. **EDA**: Exploring the dataset to gain insights and understand its characteristics using visualizations and statistical analysis. (Note: Due to the limitations of GitHub in directly displaying Plotly graphs, you can click `Open in Colab` to view the visualization.)
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming existing features to improve the predictive power of the models. This includes processing categorical and numerical variables appropriately.
5. **Model Building**: Developing machine learning and deep learning models for predicting the hotel cancellation rate.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.
